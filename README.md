## Abstract

**Donald Deck** is a browser-based card game service that allows users to log in to their accounts and play blackjack with their friends with a computer dealer. Players can create and join a lobby where they can play with their friends simultaneously, or they can also choose to play with an AI opponent. This service is intended to be mobile-friendly, so a group of bored friends can simply pull out their phones and start a round of Blackjack. Players can also choose to chat with each other using an online chatroom while playing. If given extra time, we will consider implementing features such as more game modes including different card games, a chat filter, as well as public rooms which can be displayed and can be joined by anyone.

## Overview

* How is this problem solved currently (if at all)? 
    * Currently, blackjack apps and games exist, but we wish to bridge the gap with a very simple device-agnostic implementation in which anyone can join and play that can be added onto later. (i.e., expand game library).  Many of the current apps and games also exist behind a pay-to-win wall, contain several intrusive ads, or follow a real money gambling model. We want to create a free service that is easy to use without downloading anything (hence browser-based) and mobile-friendly.

* How will this project make life better? Is it educational or just for entertainment?
    * Initially, the project is just for entertainment but can be also used as an educational tool for those interested in blackjack and all its mechanisms.
        * Learning tool/resource in that it is a risk-free way to learn the basics (i.e., no    monetary commitment)

* Who is the target audience? Who will play your game? What is the scope of your project? 
    * people who want to play card games with friends and others without actually meeting up in   person
    * people who want to play card games but don’t have a physical deck present
    * people who are just bored and need a fast way to kill time without installing a game

* What are some sample stories/scenarios? For example, as a regular user to your site, what types of things can I do? These are the ‘stories’ of your project.
    * A bored group of friends wishes to play something altogether. But no one brought a deck of cards! Since everyone today has their own phone, they can go onto the website and play together. No more arguing about the dealer being unfair to a certain person because the dealer is the computer! 
    * A single person can also play alone as well by logging on, where they can choose to play with AI agents.

* Be honest, is the amount of work required in this proposal enough for five group members?
    * Yes. Due to the flexible nature of our project, we can add more games/features if we find the amount of work required lacking
